> **Reach** scrapes recruiter emails from LinkedIn and fires off personalized emails with your resume attached — fully automated, one click, zero manual effort.

<br/>

## ⚡ What is Reach?

Most job seekers spend **hours** doing this manually:

```
Search LinkedIn → Find recruiter → Copy email → Open Gmail → Write email → Attach resume → Send → Repeat
```

**Reach collapses that entire pipeline into a single form submission.**

```
Fill form → Click Start → Watch it happen → Done.
```

You enter your Gmail, an App Password, a job keyword, and upload your resume.  
Reach handles everything else — browser automation, scraping, composing, and sending.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| 🎨 Frontend | React + Plain CSS | Modern glassmorphism UI, zero dependencies |
| 🔌 HTTP | Axios | FormData POST with multipart support |
| 🖥️ Backend | Node.js + Express | Fast REST API, clean middleware chain |
| 📁 File Upload | Multer | Disk storage for resume files |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `v18+`
- Gmail account with **2-Step Verification** enabled
- A **Google App Password** ([How to get one ↓](#-google-app-password-setup))

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/reach.git
cd reach

# 2. Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# 3. Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd server
node server.js
# ✓ Server running at http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd client
npm run dev
# ✓ Open http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔑 Google App Password Setup

> Regular Gmail passwords won't work. You need an **App Password** — a 16-character token Google generates specifically for apps.

```
Step 1  →  Go to myaccount.google.com
Step 2  →  Security → 2-Step Verification (enable it)
Step 3  →  Search "App Passwords" in the search bar
Step 4  →  Select app: Mail  |  Select device: Windows Computer
Step 5  →  Click Generate
Step 6  →  Copy the 16-character password  →  Paste into Reach
```

✅ Your main Gmail password is **never** used or stored.

## 🧠 Engineering Challenges

Building this wasn't straightforward. Here are the real problems solved:

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 LinkedIn Bot Detection</b></summary>

<br/>

LinkedIn checks `navigator.webdriver` in JavaScript to detect Puppeteer.

```js
// Run before any page loads — hides the Puppeteer fingerprint
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() => {
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, "webdriver", { get: () => undefined });
});

// Also spoof the User-Agent
await page.setUserAgent("Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...");
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎯 Selector Stability — LinkedIn uses random class names</b></summary>

<br/>

LinkedIn generates random IDs and class names on every page load:

```html
<!-- These change every session — useless as selectors -->
<input id=":r3:" class="efb8f1b0 _122158cd _7d9cda5f ...">
```

The fix: target **semantic HTML attributes** that LinkedIn cannot randomize:

```js
// Stable — tied to HTML/accessibility spec
"input[autocomplete='username webauthn']"   // email
"input[autocomplete='current-password']"    // password
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⌨️ The Tab Key Solution (hardest bug)</b></summary>

<br/>

The password field was consistently not found by Puppeteer — even though it was visible in the DOM. LinkedIn's React re-renders the form after email input loses focus, and the password field's event listeners aren't attached yet.

Tried and failed:
- `waitForSelector` with multiple selectors
- `scrollIntoView` + `focus` + 2000ms delay  
- Targeting `autocomplete='current-password'` directly

**The fix that worked:**

```js
await emailField.type(LINKEDIN_EMAIL, { delay: 80 });

// Press Tab — exactly like a real user would
// LinkedIn's own JS moves focus to the password field
await page.keyboard.press("Tab");
await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1000));

// Type directly into the now-focused field — no selector needed
await page.keyboard.type(LINKEDIN_PASSWORD, { delay: 80 });
```

> Mimicking real user behavior was the solution. No selector. Just `Tab`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔄 Browser Lifecycle — Chromium staying open after crashes</b></summary>

<br/>

Early version had `browser.close()` after a `return` statement — unreachable code. Puppeteer processes were piling up.

```js
// ❌ browser.close() never runs
return { success: true };
await browser.close(); // dead code

// ✅ finally block ALWAYS runs — success or failure
try {
  // automation...
  return { success: true };
} catch (err) {
  return { success: false };
} finally {
  await browser.close(); // guaranteed cleanup
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚛️ React Crash — "Objects are not valid as a React child"</b></summary>

<br/>

Axios automatically parses JSON responses. `res.data` was already the object `{ success, message }` — not a string. Setting that as `status.message` made React try to render an object as a DOM text node.

```js
// ❌ res.data is { success: true, message: "..." } — React can't render objects
setStatus({ type: "success", message: res.data });

// ✅ Extract just the string
setStatus({ type: "success", message: res.data.message });
```

</details>

---

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ **Zero credential storage** — Gmail and App Password exist only in memory during the request
- ✅ **App Password scoped** — not your main Gmail password, revocable anytime
- ✅ **No database** — nothing is persisted beyond the uploaded resume file
- ✅ **In-memory processing** — all sensitive data is garbage collected after the async function resolves

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-page scraping — scroll through multiple result pages
- [ ] Email personalization — use recruiter name + company in body
- [ ] Rate limiting — configurable delay between sends
- [ ] Resume parsing — auto-extract name & skills for smarter outreach  
- [ ] Sent emails dashboard — track history, status, replies
- [ ] Docker support — one-command deployment
